The data was preprocessed into specific pickle files 
and our code runs on the same pickle file inputs.

Since the pickled files were too large too attach, we have
skipped sending them and will show them directly at the 
demonstration.

Codes for LR (ZeroHidden.py) 
and 
Greater than 1 hidden layers (GT1Hidden.py)
are attached.

Also, attached is a report which shows cost vs iteration
and confusion matrix for each configuration of NN we tested.
